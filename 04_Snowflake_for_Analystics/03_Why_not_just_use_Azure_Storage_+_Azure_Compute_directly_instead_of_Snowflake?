Why not just use Azure Storage + Azure Compute directly instead of Snowflake?

Azure gives you building blocks (ADLS/Blob for storage, Synapse/Databricks/VMs for compute). You assemble and manage them.
Snowflake is a fully managed cloud data warehouse (SaaS) with built-in SQL engine, optimizer, metadata, security, and elastic “virtual warehouses.”
Choose Snowflake when you want fast, concurrent analytics with minimal ops. Choose native Azure when you need broader data/ML/streaming flexibility or tight Azure integration. Many companies use both: Azure Data Lake + Snowflake DW.

What “Azure Storage + Compute” typically means:
Storage: ADLS Gen2 or Blob for files (CSV, Parquet, JSON, images, logs).
Compute: Synapse SQL pools, Spark (Synapse or Databricks), Azure Functions/AKS/VMs.
Orchestration: Data Factory/Synapse pipelines.
You manage clusters, scale, tuning, indexing/partitioning strategies, and concurrency behavior.

What Snowflake provides:
SaaS data warehouse: no servers/clusters to manage, no patching.
Separation of storage and compute with on-demand virtual warehouses that auto-pause/resume and scale independently.
Cost-based optimizer, automatic micro-partitioning, statistics, pruning; no manual indexes or vacuuming.
Concurrency isolation: multiple warehouses so BI, ETL, data science can run without resource contention.
Built-in features: Time Travel, Fail-safe, Zero-Copy Cloning, Secure Data Sharing, governance/policies.
Semi-structured support (VARIANT for JSON/Parquet) with SQL access.
Runs on AWS/Azure/GCP (multi-cloud).

Category-by-category comparison:

Setup and operations
Azure: you design VNETs, clusters, autoscaling, libraries, patching; more DevOps effort.
Snowflake: create warehouses and roles; minimal ops.

Performance and tuning
Azure: you plan partitions, file sizes, caching, Z-order, shuffle/skew mitigation, indexes; performance depends on your engineering.
Snowflake: automatic micro-partitioning and pruning; fewer knobs; strong defaults; easy scale-up/scale-out via larger or more warehouses.

Concurrency
Azure: many heavy users/jobs can compete for the same Spark/Synapse cluster unless you deploy multiple pools; you must size and isolate.
Snowflake: give each workload its own warehouse; true isolation; queueing is rare and easy to fix by resizing.

Feature set for analytics
Azure: rich ecosystem (streaming, ML, real-time, custom runtimes). Data sharing and versioning require separate services/patterns.
Snowflake: Time Travel (query older snapshots), Zero-Copy Cloning (instant env copies), Secure Data Sharing (no data movement), Marketplace; these accelerate analytics workflows.

Data types and workloads
Azure: best when you mix structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (images/video), streaming ingestion, ML training, lakehouse architectures.
Snowflake: best for structured + semi-structured analytics, ELT modeling, BI dashboards, SQL-first workloads at scale.

Cost model
Azure: pay for storage + running clusters; reserved capacity options; more ops time cost; can be cheaper for custom/ML if you keep clusters off.
Snowflake: pay for compressed storage + per-second warehouse credits; very cost-efficient for bursty analytics (auto-pause) and high concurrency; can cost more if you keep big warehouses running 24/7.

Security and governance
Azure: enterprise-grade RBAC with AAD, Purview for governance; you assemble the pieces.
Snowflake: RBAC, masking, row-level policies, access history, easy object-level governance built in; integrates with AAD/SSO.

Ecosystem and integration
Azure: deepest native integration with Power BI, AAD, Event Hub, Logic Apps, Azure ML.
Snowflake: broad ecosystem (including Power BI and Fabric via connectors) and cross-cloud portability; not a full replacement for Azure’s wider platform services.

When Snowflake is the better fit:
Many analysts/BI tools hitting the warehouse simultaneously (high concurrency).
You want minimal ops and fast time-to-value for SQL analytics.
Strong need for Time Travel, Zero-Copy Cloning (dev/test/QA copies in seconds), and data sharing with partners.
Mixed teams (ETL, BI, DS) need isolation without cluster management.

When native Azure is the better fit:
Heavy ML/AI training, custom runtimes, streaming/real-time processing, or event-driven microservices.
You need to manage unstructured data lakes, lakehouse patterns, and complex pipelines tightly integrated with other Azure services.
Cost is optimized around long-running Spark/Synapse pools you already tune well.

Common enterprise pattern (hybrid):
Land raw data in ADLS Gen2 (Bronze).
Transform with ADF or Databricks/Synapse Spark (Silver).
Load curated, query-optimized models to Snowflake (Gold) for BI/self-service analytics.
Visualize in Power BI; share data externally via Snowflake Secure Data Sharing.

Pitfalls to avoid:
Using Snowflake for heavy custom ML training (use Databricks/Azure ML and push results to Snowflake).
Keeping huge Snowflake warehouses running 24/7 (use auto-pause and right-size).
Running all analytics on a single Azure compute cluster and wondering about contention (isolate pools/warehouses per workload).
Writing tiny CSV files to the lake (inefficient); use optimized Parquet/size files well even if you later load Snowflake.

Decision checklist (quick yes/no):
Need minimal ops with high SQL concurrency? → Snowflake.
Need deep ML/streaming/custom runtimes and unstructured processing? → Azure compute + ADLS.
Need cross-org data sharing and fast environment cloning? → Snowflake.
Already standardized on Azure services and teams are strong in Spark/Synapse? → Azure may be simpler and cheaper.
Prefer multi-cloud portability for analytics? → Snowflake.

One-sentence takeaway:
Azure is the toolbox for any data/ML workload; Snowflake is the turnkey SQL analytics warehouse. Most mature stacks use Azure Data Lake for raw data and Snowflake for fast, concurrent analytics.
