t_shirt_sizing_in_cloud_and_snowflake

1. what_is_t_shirt_sizing
   - A method of standardizing resource capacity using simple size labels like XS, S, M, L, XL.
   - Instead of dealing directly with CPU cores, memory GB, or I/O units, cloud vendors map those into sizes.
   - Helps users pick capacity without deep infra knowledge.
   - Often used in cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) and in data platforms like Snowflake.

2. t_shirt_sizing_in_cloud_services
   - compute_services (AWS EC2, Azure VMs, GCP Compute Engine)
     * Instance sizes (t2.small, m5.large, etc.) → map to vCPUs + RAM.
     * Example: S = 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM; M = 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM.
   - database_services (RDS, Cosmos DB, BigQuery slots)
     * Provisioned in T-shirt sizes for performance tiers.
   - container_and_serverless (AKS, ECS, Lambda)
     * Sizes define memory/CPU bundles.
   - benefit: abstracts complexity, makes capacity planning easier.

3. t_shirt_sizing_in_snowflake
   - snowflake_warehouses (compute clusters) are provisioned using T-shirt sizes.
   - Sizes: X-Small (XS), Small (S), Medium (M), Large (L), up to 6XL (XXXL, etc.).
   - each_size = fixed bundle of compute resources (virtual nodes).
   - doubling rule:
       * Each size up → doubles number of compute resources.
       * Example:
         XS → 1 cluster unit,
         S → 2 units,
         M → 4 units,
         L → 8 units,
         XL → 16 units.
   - cost scaling:
       * Billing is per second, per warehouse size.
       * Larger size = higher cost per second but faster query execution (parallelism).
   - use_case examples:
       * XS → ad-hoc queries, dev/testing.
       * M/L → medium data transformations, ETL.
       * XL+ → heavy analytics, ML workloads.

4. summary
   - t_shirt_sizing = abstraction of compute capacity into simple labels.
   - in_cloud: used across compute, databases, storage tiers.
   - in_snowflake: defines virtual warehouse size; scaling is linear (each step doubles capacity).
   - advantage: simple to choose, auto-scale up/down with predictable pricing.
