Metadata Manager in Snowflake
-----------------------------

Is it free?
âœ… Yes. Querying metadata (like DESCRIBE, SHOW, INFORMATION_SCHEMA views) 
   does not require a running warehouse. 
   These queries are answered by Metadata Manager instantly.

When does it cost us?
ðŸ’° Costs are incurred only when:
   1. You need to scan or process actual data (e.g., SELECT * FROM table).
      â†’ A warehouse must be running, and you pay compute credits.
   2. Query needs uncached results (Metadata Manager doesnâ€™t have them).
      â†’ Warehouse spins up to fetch from storage.
   3. Storing metadata itself does not cost extra (itâ€™s included in Snowflake service layer),
      but underlying data storage always costs.
