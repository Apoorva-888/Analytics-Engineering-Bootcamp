Definition:
Medallion Architecture is a data design pattern (popularized by Databricks Lakehouse) where data flows through multiple progressively refined layers — typically Bronze → Silver → Gold.
It ensures data quality, traceability, and optimized consumption.

1. Bronze Layer — Raw / Ingestion Layer
Purpose: Store raw data exactly as it comes from source systems.
Characteristics:
    Data state: Unprocessed, unvalidated.
    Sources: OLTP DB dumps, IoT streams, logs, APIs, CSV/Parquet/JSON files, streaming feeds.
    Schema: Loose or semi-structured; minimal or no transformations.
    Storage: Data Lake / Lakehouse (S3, ADLS, GCS) in cost-efficient formats like Parquet, ORC, Avro, JSON.
    Processing: Append-only (no updates unless re-ingesting full data).
    Retention: Often long-term for reprocessing/replay.
Goals:
    Preserve original fidelity for audit/compliance.
    Enable replay in case transformation logic changes.
    Handle schema drift from sources.

Example:
| timestamp        | device\_id | temp | humidity | raw\_payload |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ |
| 2025-08-13 10:00 | dev123     | 28.2 | 65%      | `{...}`      |

2. Silver Layer — Cleansed & Conformed Layer
Purpose: Make data analytics-ready by cleaning, conforming, and joining from multiple bronze sources.
Characteristics:
    Data state: Filtered, validated, enriched.
    Common actions:
        Remove duplicates.
        Handle null/missing values.
        Apply data type conversions.
        Standardize units & formats.
        Join related datasets (e.g., orders + customers).
        Enforce business keys.
    Schema: Enforced & consistent across domains.
    Storage: Parquet/Delta with optimized partitioning & Z-ordering.
    Processing: Upserts allowed (using Delta Lake or Merge statements).
Goals:
    Improve quality for downstream analytics.
    Remove unusable or corrupted records.
    Create a single source of truth for entities.
Example:
| order\_id | customer\_id | order\_date | total\_amount | country |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| 1001      | C123         | 2025-08-10  | 250.00        | India   |

3. Gold Layer — Business-Ready / Presentation Layer
Purpose: Provide aggregated, business-friendly datasets for BI dashboards, ML models, or APIs.
Characteristics:
    Data state: Curated, aggregated, and ready for consumption.
    Common actions:
        Summarization (daily/monthly sales, KPIs).
        Feature engineering for ML.
        Star/Snowflake schema creation for BI tools.
        Pre-computations to speed up queries.
    Schema: Highly structured, business-friendly.
    Storage: Same lake but optimized for fast reads (caching, indexes).
    Consumption: Power BI, Tableau, Looker, ML pipelines, APIs.

Goals:
    Serve business needs with minimal transformation at query time.
    Enable self-service analytics for non-technical users.
    Keep performance high with pre-aggregated datasets.

Example:
| month   | region | total\_sales | avg\_order\_value | repeat\_customer\_rate |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 2025-08 | APAC   | 5,200,000    | 280.50            | 32%                    |

Benefits
    Traceability: Easy to track where transformations happen.
    Data Quality Management: Errors handled progressively.
    Flexibility: Reprocess from earlier stages if logic changes.
    Scalability: Works well with batch or streaming data.
    Separation of Concerns: Each layer has a clear purpose.

Best Practices
    Use Delta Lake or similar for ACID transactions & schema enforcement.
    Partition and Z-order large datasets for performance.
    Maintain data contracts between layers to avoid breaking downstream jobs.
    Automate ingestion & transformation pipelines (Airflow, Databricks Jobs).
    Implement data quality checks (Great Expectations, Deequ).
