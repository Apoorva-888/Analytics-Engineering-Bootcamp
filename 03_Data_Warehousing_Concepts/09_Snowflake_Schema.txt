Snowflake Schema Overview
    Definition: A variation of the star schema where dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables.
    Key Point: Dimensions are split into sub-dimensions to reduce data redundancy.
Trade-off:
    ✅ Saves storage space (less duplication in dimension data).
    ❌ Requires more joins → slightly slower queries compared to Star Schema.

2. Difference from Star Schema
Star Schema:
    Each dimension is a single table.
    Example: DimProduct has CategoryName directly inside it.
Snowflake Schema:
    DimProduct is split into DimProduct → DimCategory → DimDepartment tables.

   Snowflake Schema (After Normalization)
             DimDate
               |
DimStore — FactSales — DimProduct — DimCategory — DimDepartment
               |
           DimCustomer — DimRegion
Explanation of changes:
DimProduct split into:
      DimProduct (ProductID, ProductName, CategoryID)
      DimCategory (CategoryID, CategoryName, DepartmentID)
      DimDepartment (DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
DimCustomer split into:
      DimCustomer (CustomerID, Name, RegionID)
      DimRegion (RegionID, RegionName)
