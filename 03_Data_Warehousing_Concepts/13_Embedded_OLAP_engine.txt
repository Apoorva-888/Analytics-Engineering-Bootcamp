What is “embedded OLAP engine”?
OLAP = Online Analytical Processing → designed for analytical queries (aggregations, filtering, joins) on large datasets.
Embedded = runs inside your application (here, your Python process in Google Colab) without needing a separate database server.
DuckDB is like having a mini Snowflake / BigQuery engine right inside your notebook.

💡 In our code, when you ran:
con = duckdb.connect()
result = con.execute(f"SELECT ... FROM parquet_scan('{parquet_path}')").fetchdf()
That’s DuckDB acting as an OLAP engine — no server, no cluster, no cloud billing — just instant analytics.

2️⃣ “Fast analytics in notebooks”
DuckDB can directly read Parquet without loading all data into memory (memory-mapped files).
It uses vectorized execution: processes data in batches instead of row-by-row like Pandas.
It supports parallel processing: uses all available CPU cores by default.
This is why your Parquet DuckDB benchmark ran faster than Parquet Pandas.
📌 Example from your benchmark:
Pandas Parquet → had to load DataFrame → then groupby.
DuckDB Parquet → scanned only the required columns → aggregated directly → returned results.

3️⃣ “Without requiring a big data cluster”
Normally, for 1M+ rows:
With Pandas: you risk hitting memory limits (especially in Google Colab).
With Spark/Snowflake: you’d need a cluster or cloud warehouse (cost + setup time).
With DuckDB:
Runs in your laptop or Colab memory space.
Still handles billions of rows efficiently as long as they fit on disk, thanks to streaming queries.
No dependency on external infrastructure.

4️⃣ Why this is perfect for your Medallion Architecture idea
DuckDB can:
Bronze: Ingest raw CSV files.
Silver: Store cleaned/filtered data as Parquet.
Gold: Run fast aggregations and export results.
All in one notebook session, without Spark or SQL warehouses.

5️⃣ Real-world analogy
Think of DuckDB as:
“SQLite for analytics”
While SQLite is great for transactional apps (OLTP), DuckDB is optimized for analytical workloads (OLAP).
