1. Fact Table 📊
What it stores:
    Measurements, metrics, or facts about a business process.
    Usually numeric, additive data (things you can sum, average, etc.).
    Linked to dimension tables via foreign keys.
Examples:
    sales_amount, units_sold, revenue, click_count.
In an Online Retail schema, the FactSales table might have:
    date_key | product_key | store_key | sales_amount | units_sold
Characteristics:
    Large — contains many rows.
    Granular — each row is one event or transaction.
    Foreign Keys + Measures.

2. Dimension Table 🗂️
What it stores:
    Descriptive attributes that give context to facts.
    Mostly textual or categorical data.
Examples:
    Products: product_name, category, brand.
    Time: date, month, quarter.
    Location: city, state, country.
Characteristics:
    Smaller than fact tables.
    Descriptive — helps slice and dice facts.
    Primary key links to fact table’s foreign key.

3. How They Work Together
Example: A sales analysis query
```sql
SELECT 
    d.date,
    p.category,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM FactSales f
JOIN DimDate d ON f.date_key = d.date_key
JOIN DimProduct p ON f.product_key = p.product_key
GROUP BY d.date, p.category;
```
