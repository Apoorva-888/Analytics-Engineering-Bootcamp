project_lifecycle:
- idea_or_problem_identification → find business problem/opportunity
- requirements_gathering → understand what stakeholders want
- design → create data model, wireframes, dashboard mockups
- development → build pipelines, ETL, dashboards
- testing → validate correctness, accuracy, usability
- deployment → move solution to prod, users access dashboards
- monitoring & maintenance → keep dashboards updated, fix bugs, improve

information_vs_insight:
- information = raw data, facts, numbers
  example: "Zomato had 1,00,000 orders yesterday"
- insight = action-oriented conclusion derived from information
  example: "60% of cancelled orders were from city X due to delivery delays"
- difference → info tells 'what happened', insight tells 'why it happened & what to do'

problem_statement (example: zomato sales analysis):
- find how sales are performing for Zomato
- understand orders, cancellations, delivery success
- identify patterns by location, delivery partners, time

role_of_business_analyst/consultant:
- define KPIs to track
  - total_orders
  - successful_orders
  - cancelled_orders
  - failed_orders
  - revenue
  - avg_delivery_time
- define dimensions for analysis
  - cities
  - delivery_person
  - time_of_delivery (hour/day/month)
  - cuisine_type
- BA ensures business requirements are clear

role_of_data_analyst:
- identify what information/columns are needed
  - order_id
  - customer_id
  - city
  - delivery_person_id
  - order_status (success, failed, cancelled)
  - delivery_time
  - amount
- check if data is available & accessible
- verify data quality (is data_clean? consistent? duplicates? missing values?)
- prepare questions for deeper analysis
- build visuals → charts, dashboards
- generate insights → story around business impact

role_of_data_engineer / analytics_engineer:
- create pipeline to make data consumable for DA
- steps:
  - ingest raw data from source (mysql, kafka, api, etc.)
  - clean & transform → remove duplicates, handle nulls
  - create schema → tables/views in data warehouse
  - aggregate tables for quick reporting
  - ensure DA can query easily
- output: curated tables/views ready for analysis

role_of_data_analyst (visualization):
- design wireframe first → rough sketch of dashboard (on paper/figma)
- then build dashboard in tool (Tableau/Power BI/Looker)
- add charts:
  - bar_chart (orders by city)
  - line_chart (orders trend over time)
  - pie_chart (successful vs cancelled orders)
  - map_chart (orders by geography)
- create story → "Orders are high in metro cities, but cancellations are highest during weekends in tier-2 cities due to fewer delivery persons"
- provide actionable insights

important_note:
- tool (Tableau, Power BI, matplotlib, etc.) is secondary
- what's important is process: 
  - define_problem → gather_requirements → design_wireframe → build_pipeline → clean_data → dashboard → generate_insights

workflow_summary:
1. problem_statement defined by BA/Consultant
2. BA defines KPIs & dimensions
3. DA asks what data is needed → columns → checks quality
4. DE/AE builds pipeline & consumable views
5. DA builds visuals & dashboard
6. insights are generated
7. decision-making by management

rule_of_thumb:
- always create wireframe first before building dashboard
- dashboard without planning = wasted effort
