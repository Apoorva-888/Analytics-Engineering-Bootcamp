tableau_skills
--------------------------------------

1) basic_charts  
- bar chart → compare categories.  
- line chart → trends over time.  
- pie/donut chart → proportions.  
- scatter plot → correlation.  
- maps → geographic analysis (using geographic role).  
- tree map → hierarchical data.  
- heat map → density or intensity visualization.  

2) advanced_charts  
- dual axis chart → combine 2 measures on same axis.  
- waterfall chart → running total effect.  
- gantt chart → project timelines.  
- box plot → distribution and outliers.  
- bullet graph → compare performance vs target.  
- funnel chart → stages of a process.  

3) tableau_calculations  
- calculated fields → custom formulas (ex: profit ratio = profit/sales).  
- table calculations → running sum, percent of total, moving average.  
- LOD (level of detail) expressions →  
   * fixed → aggregation at fixed dimension.  
   * include → adds more detail.  
   * exclude → removes detail from aggregation.  

4) data_connections  
- connect to excel, csv, sql, oracle, cloud sources (snowflake, aws redshift, gcp bigquery).  
- live connection vs extract (.hyper file).  
- join types → inner, left, right, full.  
- blending vs joining data.  
- relationships in new data model.  

5) dashboard_building  
- design multiple worksheets.  
- drag worksheets into dashboard.  
- add filters, parameters, actions (highlight, filter, URL).  
- responsive layouts for web/mobile.  
- best practice: limit filters to avoid performance issues.  

6) tableau_prep (etl_lightweight)  
- clean, shape, and join datasets before loading into tableau.  
- remove nulls, rename fields, pivot/unpivot.  
- create flows and schedule refresh.  

7) deployment  
- publish workbooks/dashboards to tableau server / tableau cloud.  
- schedule refreshes of extracts.  
- manage permissions (role-based security).  
- performance monitoring (dashboard load time, extract refresh).  

8) performance_tuning  
- use extracts over live when possible.  
- reduce number of quick filters.  
- hide unused fields.  
- aggregate data before bringing to tableau.  
- optimize joins/blends.  

9) tableau_commands / shortcuts  
- F7 → show/hide sidebar.  
- CTRL + drag field → duplicate field.  
- CTRL + Z → undo, CTRL + Y → redo.  
- right-click → context menu (filters, sorts, create calc).  
- drag fields to "columns/rows" → build views.  

10) soft_skills_for_tableau_role  
- storytelling with data → explain insights simply.  
- requirement gathering → what does the business want to measure?  
- documentation → data source details, calculation logic.  
- collaboration → work with data engineers, analysts.
