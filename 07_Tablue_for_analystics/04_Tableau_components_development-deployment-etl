-------------------------------------------------

2) DEPLOYMENT
--------------
a) Tableau Cloud (formerly Tableau Online)
- Fully hosted SaaS version of Tableau Server managed by Salesforce.

NOTES
-----
- Workflow in Tableau:
   Tableau Prep → Tableau Desktop (develop dashboards) → Tableau Server/Cloud (deploy & share)
- Tableau Public is mainly for individuals; not for enterprises.
- Tableau Cloud vs Server depends on hosting preference:
   * Cloud = Salesforce-managed, less IT overhead.
   * Server = Company-managed, more control.
- Power BI is generally cheaper than Tableau for small to mid-sized orgs.
