geographic_role
----------------
1) definition  
- a metadata tag that tells the BI tool (tableau, power bi, qlik etc.) that a field represents a geographic location.  
- examples: country, state, city, postal code, latitude/longitude.  

2) purpose  
- enables automatic mapping: tool recognizes the field as location-based.  
- allows visualization on maps (heatmaps, filled maps, symbol maps).  
- supports spatial analysis (distance, clustering, region-based aggregation).  

3) usage beyond visualization  
- geo role is not only for maps.  
- used in data prep to standardize location fields.  
- can be applied in filters (region-based filtering).  
- enables drill-down hierarchy (country → state → city).  
- useful in geospatial analytics (catchment areas, logistics, sales region analysis).  

4) in visualization tools  
- tableau: "assign geographic role" to fields for mapping.  
- power bi: "data category = geography" for fields.  
- qlik: similar geo tagging for location intelligence.
