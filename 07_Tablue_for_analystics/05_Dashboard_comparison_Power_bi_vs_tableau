DASHBOARD COMPARISON – POWER BI vs TABLEAU
------------------------------------------

POWER BI
--------
1) Where Dashboards Live  
- Dashboards can ONLY be created and hosted in Power BI Service (Cloud).  
- Power BI Desktop = build reports only, no dashboards.  

2) Purpose  
- KPI monitoring across datasets.  
- One-page summaries, lightweight monitoring.  

3) Sharing  
- Needs Power BI Service (Pro/Premium license).  
- Sharing limited if only using free desktop version.  

------------------------------------------

TABLEAU
--------
1) Where Dashboards Live  
- Dashboards are created directly inside Tableau Desktop.  
- Can be hosted on Tableau Server / Tableau Cloud for collaboration.  

2) Purpose  
- Rich data storytelling with multiple sheets, filters, interactivity.  
- Used for both monitoring and deep exploration.  

3) Sharing  
- Publish dashboards to Tableau Server/Cloud and share securely.  
- Supports role-based governance.  

------------------------------------------

KEY DIFFERENCE
--------------
- Power BI → Dashboards = Cloud-only, need Service to host.  
- Tableau → Dashboards = Built in Desktop itself, can host via Server/Cloud.
