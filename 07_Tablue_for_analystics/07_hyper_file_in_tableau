hyper_file_in_tableau
----------------------

1) definition  
- .hyper is tableau’s proprietary in-memory data engine file format.  
- it stores compressed, optimized, and columnar structured data.  

2) purpose  
- makes queries and dashboards faster by keeping data in-memory.  
- supports big data volumes with fast performance.  
- improves extract creation and refresh times.  

3) usage  
- created when you make an "extract" in tableau desktop.  
- extract = a snapshot of your data stored in .hyper format.  
- used for offline analysis (no live connection needed).  
- published to tableau server / tableau cloud for deployment.  

4) advantages  
- columnar storage → better aggregation speed.  
- compression → reduces file size.  
- parallel query execution → handles multiple users efficiently.  
- incremental refresh supported → only new data is updated.  

5) real-world example  
- instead of connecting live to a 10M row SQL table each time,  
  you create a .hyper extract. Tableau dashboards load instantly.
